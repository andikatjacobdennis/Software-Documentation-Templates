# Glossary

## A

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

- **Agile Methodology**: A software development methodology that promotes iterative development, flexibility, and collaboration among cross-functional teams. Agile emphasizes delivering small, incremental improvements over time.

## B

- **Bug**: An error or flaw in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. Bugs can range from minor issues to critical failures that affect the system's functionality.

- **Build**: A version of the software that has been compiled and packaged for testing or deployment. A build typically includes all the latest code changes, configurations, and dependencies.

## C

- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: A set of practices aimed at automating the integration, testing, and deployment processes. CI ensures that code changes are automatically integrated and tested, while CD focuses on automating the deployment of the application to production.

- **Client-Server Architecture**: A software architecture in which a server provides services or resources to client devices or applications. Clients send requests to servers, which then process the requests and return the appropriate responses.

## D

- **Defect**: An issue or flaw in the software that leads to incorrect or undesired behavior. A defect may arise due to errors in code, design, or implementation.

- **Deployment**: The process of making a software system or application available for use by end-users, typically through installation or configuration on servers or devices.

## E

- **End User**: The person or organization that uses the software system to perform tasks, solve problems, or achieve specific goals.

- **Environment**: The combination of hardware, software, network infrastructure, and configurations where the software application is deployed and executed.

## F

- **Feature**: A specific functionality or capability of the software that delivers value to the end-user. Features are typically part of the overall product roadmap.

- **Failure**: A condition in which the software system is unable to perform its intended function, often leading to a breakdown in service or user experience.

## G

- **Git**: A distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to source code, collaborate on development, and manage different versions of a software project.

## H

- **Hotfix**: A quick fix or patch applied to the software to resolve critical issues, often deployed directly to production environments to address urgent problems.

## I

- **Incident**: An event that disrupts the normal functioning of the software system, such as an unexpected crash, performance degradation, or security breach.

- **Interface**: A boundary between two software systems or components that allows them to communicate and exchange data, typically defined through APIs, user interfaces, or hardware connections.

## J

- **Jira**: A popular project management and issue tracking tool used by development teams to manage tasks, track progress, and report issues.

## K

- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company, team, or individual is achieving key business objectives. In the context of software, KPIs are used to evaluate system performance, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## L

- **Latency**: The time delay between initiating a request and receiving a response in a system. High latency can negatively affect system performance and user experience.

- **Load Balancer**: A system component that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.

## M

- **Maintenance**: The process of updating, fixing, and improving the software after it has been released. Maintenance activities include corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive tasks.

- **Microservices**: An architectural style where a software application is developed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services that focus on specific business functionalities.

## N

- **Node**: A basic unit of computation in a network, system, or distributed environment. In the context of server architectures, a node typically refers to a machine that processes data or performs operations.

- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Requirements that define the quality attributes of a system, such as performance, scalability, security, and usability, rather than the specific features or functionalities of the system.

## O

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes containing data and methods. OOP principles include inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

- **Operational Support**: Activities that ensure the ongoing operation and support of a system in a production environment, including monitoring, incident management, user support, and system maintenance.

## P

- **Patch**: A small update to a software system that fixes a bug, security vulnerability, or other issue without changing the system's overall functionality.

- **Performance Testing**: The process of testing a software system to evaluate its responsiveness, scalability, and stability under load, ensuring it meets the required performance criteria.

## Q

- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: The process of ensuring that the software meets predefined standards and is free of defects. QA activities include testing, reviewing, and validating software during development and post-release.

## R

- **Release**: A version of the software that has been formally completed, tested, and made available for use. A release may be a major, minor, or patch version depending on the scope of changes.

- **Root Cause Analysis**: The process of identifying the underlying cause of an issue or failure to prevent it from recurring in the future.

## S

- **Scalability**: The ability of a software system to handle increased load or demand by expanding its capacity, typically by adding resources like servers, storage, or bandwidth.

- **Security Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in a system's security defenses that could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.

## T

- **Testing**: The process of evaluating a software system to ensure it functions as intended and meets the requirements. Testing may include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests.

- **Ticketing System**: A tool or platform used to track, manage, and resolve incidents, support requests, and other tasks related to the system's operation or maintenance.

## U

- **User Story**: A short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the end-user. User stories are used in Agile development to guide development work.

- **Uptime**: The amount of time a system is available and functional, typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.9% uptime indicates the system is down for no more than 8.76 hours per year).

## V

- **Version Control**: A system used to track and manage changes to source code over time. Popular version control systems include Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

## W

- **Workflow**: A defined series of tasks or processes that are executed to complete a specific task or achieve a goal within the software system or business process.
