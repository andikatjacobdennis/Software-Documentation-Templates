## 2. **Troubleshooting**

### 2.1. **Issue: Platform not starting after installation**

**Description**:
After installing the **YourProductName** platform, the system fails to start.

**Possible Causes**:
- Missing or incorrect environment variables.
- Dependencies not installed or improperly configured.
- Insufficient system resources (e.g., not enough RAM or disk space).

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Verify system requirements**: Ensure that your machine meets the platform's minimum system requirements (refer to the **System Requirements** section above).
2. **Check environment variables**: Ensure that all required environment variables are set. You can find the list of necessary environment variables in the **[Configuration Guide](configuration_guide.md)**.
3. **Check logs**: Review the logs for any error messages. The logs can be found in the `/logs/` directory. Look for common errors like missing dependencies or insufficient resources.
4. **Restart the system**: Reboot your machine to ensure all processes and services are correctly initialized.
5. **Reinstall dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (for Python dependencies) and `npm install` (for Node.js dependencies) to reinstall missing or outdated packages.

If the issue persists, please contact support.

### 2.2. **Issue: API requests failing with 500 Internal Server Error**

**Description**:
API requests to the platform are returning a **500 Internal Server Error**.

**Possible Causes**:
- Issues with server configuration or resources.
- Unhandled exceptions in the API code.
- Incorrect API parameters or malformed requests.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check API logs**: Review the API logs to identify any errors or exceptions. Look for stack traces that could provide more information about the root cause.
2. **Verify API parameters**: Ensure that the parameters sent in the API request are correct. Refer to the **[API Documentation](https://mydomain.org/mysite/apis/captured_api_endpoints/overview.md)** for the correct request formats and required fields.
3. **Check server resources**: Ensure that the server has sufficient resources (e.g., memory, CPU, and disk space) to handle incoming requests. Monitor system resources using tools like `top` or `htop`.
4. **Restart the API service**: Sometimes, restarting the API service can resolve issues caused by temporary misconfigurations or resource exhaustion. Run the following command to restart the API:
   ```
   systemctl restart yourproductname-api
   ```

If the error continues, contact support with relevant log information.

### 2.3. **Issue: Data not syncing with the database**

**Description**:
Changes made through the **YourProductName** platform are not reflected in the database.

**Possible Causes**:
- Database connection issues.
- Incorrect database configuration or permissions.
- Issues with data synchronization jobs or tasks.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check database connection**: Verify that the platform is connected to the database. You can check the connection settings in the configuration files or by running:
   ```
   psql -h <db_host> -U <db_user> -d <db_name>
   ```
2. **Verify database logs**: Check the database logs for any errors that might indicate why data synchronization is failing.
3. **Check synchronization jobs**: Ensure that any background tasks or cron jobs responsible for data synchronization are running correctly. You can check the status of these jobs by using the command:
   ```
   systemctl status yourproductname-sync-service
   ```
4. **Check database permissions**: Ensure that the database user configured for the platform has the necessary read/write permissions.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, contact support.

### 2.4. **Issue: Slow performance when processing large data sets**

**Description**:
The platform experiences slow performance or timeouts when processing large amounts of data.

**Possible Causes**:
- Insufficient hardware resources.
- Inefficient queries or algorithms.
- Lack of proper caching mechanisms.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Monitor system resources**: Use `top` or `htop` to monitor CPU and memory usage while processing large datasets. Consider upgrading system resources (e.g., more RAM, faster CPU).
2. **Optimize database queries**: Check the database for inefficient queries. Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze slow queries and add indexes where appropriate.
3. **Implement caching**: Consider adding caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data or results of expensive calculations.
4. **Review data processing logic**: Ensure that algorithms for data processing are optimized and avoid unnecessary loops or inefficient operations.

If performance issues persist, please contact support with specific details about the dataset and any related logs.
