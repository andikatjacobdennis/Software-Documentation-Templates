# Data Interface Specifications

## 1. Overview
The Data Interface Specifications describe how the system interacts with its data sources, including databases, external data services, and file systems. This section defines how data will be exchanged, the formats used for storage and communication, and the protocols for data access and manipulation. The goal is to ensure that data flows seamlessly between the system's components and external sources.

## 2. Database Interfaces

### 2.1 Database Management System (DBMS)
- **Description**: The system interacts with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for storing and retrieving data. Supported databases include **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must be able to connect to any of the supported databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).
  - All data exchange between the application and the database should be done using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.
  - The system must ensure **ACID** compliance for transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  - Data queries should be optimized for performance to ensure minimal load times for large data sets.

### 2.2 Database Schema
- **Description**: The database schema defines the structure of the data, including tables, relationships, constraints, and data types.
- **Requirements**:
  - Tables should be normalized to **3NF (Third Normal Form)** to ensure minimal data redundancy and improve data integrity.
  - The schema will include tables for:
    - **Users**: Stores information about users, such as usernames, email addresses, and roles.
    - **Orders**: Stores order details, such as product information, quantity, and pricing.
    - **Inventory**: Stores product inventory details, including stock levels and pricing.
  - Each table will have **Primary Keys** to uniquely identify records and **Foreign Keys** to maintain referential integrity across tables.

### 2.3 Data Access Methods
- **Description**: The system should use standard data access methods to interact with the database. This includes both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** access methods, depending on the use case.
- **Requirements**:
  - For CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, the system will use standard **SQL queries** or **stored procedures**.
  - The system should support **bulk inserts** for high-volume data operations to improve performance.
  - For long-running operations, asynchronous queries or background jobs will be used to avoid blocking the main application thread.
  - The system should support **data pagination** for queries returning large data sets to improve response times.

### 2.4 Data Caching
- **Description**: To optimize performance, frequently accessed data will be cached.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should use an in-memory data caching solution such as **Redis** or **Memcached** to store frequently queried data (e.g., product details, user profiles).
  - Cache expiry policies should be configured to ensure that the data remains fresh and up-to-date.
  - The system should implement **cache invalidation** to remove outdated data from the cache.

## 3. External Data Service Interfaces

### 3.1 Third-Party Data Services
- **Description**: The system will integrate with external data sources and services to import/export data or enrich its functionality. Examples include external APIs for retrieving data, payment services, or external data providers.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system will interact with third-party services through **RESTful APIs**.
  - All external API calls will be authenticated using **OAuth 2.0** or **API keys**.
  - The data returned by external APIs will be consumed in **JSON** format by default, though **XML** may also be supported for specific integrations.
  - The system must ensure that external API calls are resilient and able to handle errors gracefully (e.g., retries for transient errors, timeouts for slow responses).

### 3.2 Data Format and Transformation
- **Description**: Data exchanged between the system and external data services should be standardized to ensure consistency. Data transformation may be required when data from external services needs to be mapped to the system's internal data structures.
- **Requirements**:
  - **JSON** will be the default format for data exchange, including external APIs and data imports/exports.
  - **XML** may be used when required by the external service, and the system should be able to parse and process XML data as needed.
  - The system should include a **data transformation layer** to convert data from external formats into internal formats, ensuring compatibility.
  - When importing data from external sources, the system should validate and clean the data to ensure it meets the internal data structure requirements.

## 4. File System Interfaces

### 4.1 File Storage
- **Description**: The system will use the local file system or cloud storage services to store files (e.g., user-uploaded files, documents, logs, backups).
- **Requirements**:
  - Files will be stored in a designated **directory structure** on the file system or in a cloud storage service such as **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**.
  - File names should be unique, and the system will generate unique identifiers (e.g., UUIDs) for each file.
  - The system should support **file uploads** and **file downloads** using secure protocols (e.g., **HTTPS**).
  - The system should support file metadata, such as file type, size, and upload date.

### 4.2 File Formats
- **Description**: Files will be stored in common formats that support the required functionality, such as image, PDF, and text files.
- **Requirements**:
  - Supported file formats include:
    - **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF
    - **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT
    - **Data Files**: CSV, JSON, XML
  - The system must ensure that files are validated for correct format before allowing uploads or processing.

### 4.3 File Security
- **Description**: The system must ensure the security and integrity of files stored and exchanged.
- **Requirements**:
  - Files must be transmitted securely using **SSL/TLS** encryption during upload and download.
  - The system must implement **access control** to ensure that only authorized users can access specific files.
  - Sensitive files (e.g., containing personal information) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
  - Files must be scanned for malware before being stored or processed.

## 5. Data Synchronization and Integrity

### 5.1 Data Synchronization
- **Description**: The system must handle the synchronization of data between multiple components or services, including external systems and the database.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must support **real-time synchronization** for critical data (e.g., inventory levels, user status).
  - Non-critical data can be synchronized in **batch processes**, running periodically (e.g., every hour or day) based on business needs.
  - The system should implement **data consistency checks** to ensure that data in the database and cache is synchronized and accurate.

### 5.2 Data Integrity
- **Description**: The system must maintain data integrity across all interactions, including database operations, external data exchanges, and file storage.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Transaction management** should be used to ensure that data changes are atomic and consistent.
  - **Foreign keys** and **constraints** should be used in the database to ensure referential integrity.
  - The system must validate data before inserting or updating it in the database to prevent corruption.

## 6. Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

### 6.1 Error Logging
- **Description**: The system should log all data-related errors (e.g., database connection failures, invalid data formats, external service failures).
- **Requirements**:
  - Errors should be logged in a central log management system (e.g., **ELK Stack**, **Splunk**).
  - Error logs should include details such as the timestamp, error type, source of the error, and any relevant data.
  - Logs should be categorized by severity (e.g., **INFO**, **ERROR**, **CRITICAL**).

### 6.2 Fault Tolerance
- **Description**: The system must be able to handle data-related failures gracefully and ensure that no data loss occurs.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should implement **retry logic** for transient errors when interacting with external services (e.g., database failures, API timeouts).
  - For critical data operations, the system should support **rollback mechanisms** to ensure that data remains consistent in case of a failure during processing.
  - The system should provide **graceful degradation** for non-critical services, allowing users to continue interacting with other parts of the system if one component fails.

## 7. Data Access and Security

### 7.1 Data Encryption
- **Description**: All sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Requirements**:
  - Data exchanged over the network must be encrypted using **SSL/TLS**.
  - Sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., passwords, personal information) must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., **AES-256**).

### 7.2 Data Access Control
- **Description**: The system must implement access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to data.
- **Requirements**:
  - Data access should be role-based, with different levels of access granted based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).
  - **Audit logs** should be maintained to track data access and modification activities.
