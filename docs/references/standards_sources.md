  This standard provides guidelines for writing software requirements specifications (SRS). It ensures that requirements are well-defined, traceable, and understandable, and that the document contains all necessary details for successful software development.

- **IEEE Std 12207-2017: IEEE Standard for Software Life Cycle Processes**  
  This standard defines the processes required to develop and maintain software. It provides a framework for software lifecycle management, including requirements definition, design, development, testing, and maintenance.

- **IEEE Std 730-2014: IEEE Standard for Software Quality Assurance Plans**  
  This standard provides guidance for the creation of software quality assurance (SQA) plans. It ensures that a systematic approach is followed to ensure that software products meet the required quality standards.

- **IEEE Std 828-2012: IEEE Standard for Software Configuration Management Plans**  
  This standard outlines best practices for software configuration management (SCM), ensuring that software changes are tracked, versioned, and controlled to maintain system integrity throughout the lifecycle.

### 2.2 ISO/IEC Standards

- **ISO/IEC 12207: Software Life Cycle Processes**  
  This international standard specifies the life cycle processes for software development, providing a framework for planning, managing, and executing software projects. It covers processes for software acquisition, supply, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning.

- **ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**  
  This international standard provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It outlines the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, and improving an ISMS.

- **ISO/IEC 25010: Systems and Software Engineering – Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)**  
  This standard provides a framework for evaluating the quality of software systems. It defines a set of software product quality characteristics, such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, and maintainability.

- **ISO/IEC 9126: Software Engineering – Product Quality**  
  This standard provides a framework for evaluating the quality of software products. It defines attributes of software quality such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, and portability.

- **ISO/IEC 90003: Software Engineering – Guidelines for the Application of ISO 9001:2000 to Software**  
  This standard provides guidelines for applying the ISO 9001:2000 quality management system standards specifically to software development processes. It ensures that software development processes comply with quality management principles.

### 2.3 W3C Standards

- **W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1**  
  These guidelines provide recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. They cover areas such as text alternatives for non-text content, navigation, and readability. Adhering to WCAG ensures that the software is usable by a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.

- **W3C HTML5 Specification**  
  This document defines the HTML5 specification, including the latest developments in web technologies for creating modern and interactive web applications. It ensures that web applications built as part of the system are compliant with current web standards.

- **W3C CSS3 Specification**  
  This specification defines the latest standard for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is used for designing the layout and appearance of web pages. Adhering to CSS3 ensures that the software's user interface is visually appealing and responsive.

### 2.4 NIST Guidelines

- **NIST SP 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations**  
  This publication from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It is widely used in industry for ensuring that software applications meet security and privacy requirements.

- **NIST SP 800-63: Digital Identity Guidelines**  
  These guidelines define the requirements for managing digital identities and authentication mechanisms. They help ensure that software systems incorporate robust and secure user authentication methods.

### 2.5 GDPR and Privacy Regulations

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
  This regulation from the European Union provides guidelines on the processing of personal data. It outlines the rights of individuals regarding their personal data and sets requirements for organizations that collect or process such data. The software system must comply with GDPR to protect user privacy and ensure data security.

- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
  This law provides California residents with the right to know what personal data is being collected, request deletion of their data, and opt out of the sale of their data. The software must comply with CCPA for users located in California.

### 2.6 Other Industry Guidelines and Best Practices

- **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)**  
  CMMI is a process improvement framework that guides software organizations in improving their development and management processes. Adhering to CMMI practices ensures that software development processes are optimized for efficiency, quality, and performance.

- **Agile Manifesto**  
  The Agile Manifesto outlines principles for Agile software development, emphasizing customer collaboration, iterative development, flexibility, and responding to change. These principles guide the development process in an Agile framework.

- **ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)**  
  ITIL is a set of practices for IT service management that aligns IT services with the needs of the business. It covers areas such as service design, transition, operation, and continual service improvement.

- **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10**  
  This document outlines the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications. It provides guidance on how to secure web applications against common threats and vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, broken authentication, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
