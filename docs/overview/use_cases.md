# Use Cases

This section describes the primary use cases for the **YourProductName** platform. Use cases represent typical interactions between users (or external systems) and the system itself. Each use case specifies the sequence of actions, starting from the user’s interaction with the system and continuing through to the system's response.

## Use Case 1: User Authentication and Authorization

### Use Case ID: UC-01

#### Description:
This use case describes how a user authenticates themselves by logging into the **YourProductName** platform, and how the system ensures that the user has the correct permissions for the requested actions.

#### Actors:
- **User**: A person who wants to access the platform.
- **System**: The **YourProductName** platform that verifies the user’s identity and manages their permissions.

#### Preconditions:
- The user must have a registered account.
- The system must be operational and accessible.

#### Basic Flow:
1. The user navigates to the login page of the **YourProductName** platform.
2. The user enters their credentials (username/email and password).
3. The system verifies the credentials against the user database.
   - If the credentials are correct, the system generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the user.
   - If the credentials are incorrect, the system displays an error message and prompts the user to retry.
4. The user is granted access to the platform and redirected to the homepage or dashboard.
5. The system stores the user’s session information (JWT) to manage subsequent requests.

#### Alternate Flows:
- **A1: Invalid Credentials**
  - If the user enters incorrect credentials, the system will display an error message ("Invalid username or password") and prompt the user to try again.
  
- **A2: Forgot Password**
  - If the user clicks "Forgot Password," the system will guide the user through the password recovery process.

#### Postconditions:
- The user is logged in and granted access to the platform, with their permissions and roles verified.

## Use Case 2: Data Retrieval from the API

### Use Case ID: UC-02

#### Description:
This use case describes how an external system or user queries the **YourProductName** platform's API to retrieve specific data, such as user details, system status, or product information.

#### Actors:
- **External System**: A third-party system or service that needs to retrieve data from the platform.
- **System**: The **YourProductName** platform that responds to the API requests.

#### Preconditions:
- The external system must be authenticated and authorized to access the API.
- The API endpoint must be available and responsive.

#### Basic Flow:
1. The external system sends a GET request to the API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{user_id}`).
2. The system validates the request, checking the authenticity of the requestor (via API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.).
3. The system retrieves the requested data from the database (e.g., user profile information).
4. The system returns the data in the form of a JSON response to the external system.
5. The external system processes the data as required (e.g., displays it to the user).

#### Alternate Flows:
- **A1: Unauthorized Access**
  - If the external system does not provide a valid authentication token, the system returns a 401 Unauthorized error and denies access.
  
- **A2: Data Not Found**
  - If the requested data is not found (e.g., a non-existent user ID), the system returns a 404 Not Found error.

#### Postconditions:
- The external system receives the requested data or an error message if the request fails.

## Use Case 3: Content Creation and Management

### Use Case ID: UC-03

#### Description:
This use case describes how an authorized user (e.g., an administrator or content creator) can create and manage content within the **YourProductName** platform. This includes adding new items, editing existing items, and deleting outdated content.

#### Actors:
- **Administrator/Content Creator**: A user who has permission to create, edit, and delete content.
- **System**: The **YourProductName** platform responsible for content management.

#### Preconditions:
- The user must be authenticated and authorized with the necessary permissions to create or manage content.

#### Basic Flow:
1. The user logs into the **YourProductName** platform with their credentials.
2. The user navigates to the content management section of the platform.
3. The user selects the option to create new content (e.g., a blog post, article, or product update).
4. The user fills out the content creation form (e.g., title, description, media, and tags).
5. The user submits the form to create the content.
6. The system validates the content, stores it in the database, and assigns the appropriate metadata (e.g., creator, timestamp, tags).
7. The user can view the newly created content and make edits if needed.

#### Alternate Flows:
- **A1: Invalid Content Input**
  - If the content does not meet required validation criteria (e.g., missing title or body), the system returns an error message prompting the user to correct the content.
  
- **A2: Content Deletion**
  - If the user opts to delete an existing piece of content, the system will prompt the user for confirmation before permanently deleting the content from the database.

#### Postconditions:
- New content is created and stored in the system.
- The content is available for users to view or interact with, based on permissions.

## Use Case 4: System Monitoring and Reporting

### Use Case ID: UC-04

#### Description:
This use case describes how system administrators can monitor the platform’s performance and generate reports related to system activity, such as user logins, resource usage, or error occurrences.

#### Actors:
- **System Administrator**: A user responsible for overseeing system health and performance.
- **System**: The **YourProductName** platform, which tracks and reports system metrics.

#### Preconditions:
- The system must be configured to track relevant data (e.g., server health, user interactions).
- The administrator must have the necessary permissions to access the monitoring tools.

#### Basic Flow:
1. The system administrator logs into the admin panel of the platform.
2. The administrator selects the monitoring or reporting section.
3. The administrator chooses the type of report or metric to generate (e.g., user activity, system errors, resource usage).
4. The system retrieves the relevant data from the database and generates a report, displaying it on the administrator’s dashboard.
5. The administrator can export the report to a file format (e.g., CSV, PDF) if needed.

#### Alternate Flows:
- **A1: No Data Available**
  - If no data matches the query parameters (e.g., no system errors in the selected timeframe), the system displays a message indicating that no results were found.

#### Postconditions:
- The administrator has access to the requested report or metric, and can use it to make decisions or address system issues.
