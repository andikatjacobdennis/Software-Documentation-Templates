# Error Handling and Status Codes

This section provides an overview of the error handling mechanisms in the **YourProductName** platform. It outlines how errors are detected, categorized, and reported. Effective error handling is crucial for diagnosing issues, ensuring smooth user experience, and maintaining system reliability.

## 1. **Error Categories**

Errors in the **YourProductName** platform are categorized into the following types:

- **Client Errors**: Errors caused by invalid input or requests from the client. These errors typically result in a `4xx` HTTP status code.
- **Server Errors**: Errors caused by issues in the server or system failures. These errors typically result in a `5xx` HTTP status code.
- **Validation Errors**: Errors resulting from invalid data input. These errors are typically specific to business logic or data constraints.
- **Authentication and Authorization Errors**: Errors related to unauthorized access or invalid credentials.

## 2. **HTTP Status Codes**

The **YourProductName** platform uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. Below are the common status codes used by the system:

### 2.1. **Success Codes** (`2xx`)

- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled and resulted in the creation of a new resource (e.g., a new user or product).
- **204 No Content**: The request has succeeded, but the server has no data to return (e.g., after a successful DELETE request).

### 2.2. **Client Error Codes** (`4xx`)

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid, often due to incorrect syntax or missing parameters.
  - Example: A required parameter is missing in the request.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication, but the user has not provided valid credentials.
  - Example: Missing or invalid authentication token.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request, but the user does not have permission to access the requested resource.
  - Example: A user attempts to access an admin endpoint but is assigned a "User" role.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  - Example: The user ID or product ID in the URL does not exist.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The request is well-formed but contains semantic errors that prevent processing.
  - Example: A user submits a form with invalid data (e.g., an email in the wrong format).

### 2.3. **Server Error Codes** (`5xx`)

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error occurred on the server that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
  - Example: A database query fails due to server-side issues.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
  - Example: Communication failure between services in a microservice architecture.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or overload.
  - Example: The API service is temporarily down for maintenance.

## 3. **Error Response Format**

When an error occurs, the server returns a detailed error response to help the client understand the issue and take corrective action. The error response body follows a standard format:

### 3.1. **Error Response Structure**

- **status**: The HTTP status code for the error.
- **error_code**: A unique error code identifying the specific error type.
- **message**: A human-readable message describing the error.
- **details** (optional): Additional details or hints to help the client resolve the issue.
- **timestamp**: The time when the error occurred.

#### Example Error Response (400 Bad Request):

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "error_code": "INVALID_INPUT",
  "message": "The 'email' field is required and cannot be empty.",
  "details": "Please provide a valid email address in the 'email' field.",
  "timestamp": "2024-11-14T15:30:00Z"
}
```

## 4. **Common Error Codes**

The following are common error codes used throughout the platform, along with their descriptions:

### 4.1. **Authentication and Authorization Errors**

- **40101 Unauthorized**: Invalid authentication token. The client must provide a valid token to access the resource.
- **40301 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to perform the requested action (e.g., a non-admin user trying to access admin-only endpoints).
- **40102 Token Expired**: The authentication token has expired and needs to be refreshed.
- **40302 Insufficient Privileges**: The userâ€™s role does not have the required permissions to access the resource or perform the action.

### 4.2. **Input Validation Errors**

- **40001 Invalid Email Format**: The provided email address is not in a valid format.
- **40002 Missing Required Field**: One or more required fields are missing from the request body.
- **40003 Invalid Data Type**: The data type of a field in the request body is incorrect (e.g., expecting a string but receiving a number).

### 4.3. **Resource Not Found Errors**

- **40401 User Not Found**: The requested user does not exist in the system.
- **40402 Product Not Found**: The requested product could not be found in the catalog.

### 4.4. **Server Errors**

- **50001 Database Error**: A database query failed due to a system error (e.g., connectivity issues or database overload).
- **50201 Bad Gateway**: The platform failed to connect to an upstream service or resource.

## 5. **Error Logging and Monitoring**

The **YourProductName** platform uses logging and monitoring tools to track and diagnose errors that occur in production. Errors are logged with sufficient details to help developers and support staff investigate the root cause. The error logs include:

- Timestamp of the error occurrence.
- HTTP request details (method, URL, headers, and body).
- User context, if applicable (e.g., user ID, role).
- Stack trace or error message for server-side issues.

The error logs are stored in a centralized logging system that is monitored in real-time for critical errors. Alerts are generated when certain thresholds of errors are reached, ensuring prompt attention from the development team.

## 6. **Best Practices for Error Handling**

To ensure that errors are handled in a consistent and user-friendly manner, the following best practices should be followed:

- **Do Not Expose Sensitive Information**: Error messages should not include sensitive information such as database structure or internal system details.
- **Provide Clear and Useful Messages**: Error messages should be clear, concise, and provide sufficient information to help the client resolve the issue (e.g., "The 'email' field is required").
- **Use Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**: Always use the correct HTTP status code to indicate the type of error. This helps both the client and server understand the nature of the failure.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: In case of errors, ensure that the system fails gracefully. This includes providing fallback mechanisms or alternative responses to mitigate the impact on the user.
- **Retry Logic**: For server errors like `500 Internal Server Error` or `503 Service Unavailable`, the client should implement retry logic where applicable.
