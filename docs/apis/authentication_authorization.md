# Authentication and Authorization

This section outlines the authentication and authorization mechanisms used in the **YourProductName** platform. These mechanisms are critical to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access protected resources and perform sensitive operations.

## 1. **Authentication**

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or service. The **YourProductName** platform uses a **token-based authentication** approach, leveraging **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.

### 1.1. **Authentication Flow**

The authentication flow for the platform is as follows:

1. **User Login**:
   - The user provides their login credentials (username/email and password) via the login API (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`).
   - The credentials are sent to the authentication service for validation.
   - If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT token, which is returned to the user.
   - The JWT token contains claims (such as user ID and role) and is signed with a secret key to ensure integrity and authenticity.

2. **Token Storage**:
   - The client stores the JWT token securely, usually in local storage or a secure cookie.
   - The token is then included in the Authorization header of subsequent API requests as a bearer token.

3. **Token Expiration**:
   - JWT tokens have an expiration time (`exp` claim), after which the user must re-authenticate.
   - If the token has expired, the client should prompt the user to log in again.

### 1.2. **Login API**

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/api/v1/auth/login`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  - **Status Code**: `200 OK`
  - **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "token": "jwt_token_here"
    }
    ```
  - The token is returned as part of the response body. The client should use this token for subsequent API requests.

### 1.3. **Logout API**

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/api/v1/auth/logout`
- **Description**: Logs out the user by invalidating the session token.
- **Response**:
  - **Status Code**: `200 OK`
  - **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Logged out successfully"
    }
    ```

## 2. **Authorization**

Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform after they have been authenticated. The **YourProductName** platform uses role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions.

### 2.1. **Roles and Permissions**

The system defines several roles with specific permissions:

1. **Admin**:
   - Full access to all resources and operations.
   - Permissions include user management, product management, and system configuration.

2. **User**:
   - Limited access to their own resources.
   - Permissions include viewing and updating their profile, and making orders.

3. **Guest**:
   - Access to view public resources only.
   - Cannot perform any write operations.

### 2.2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Once the user has authenticated and received a JWT token, the system verifies the role associated with the user. Based on this role, the system determines what operations the user can perform. 

For example:
- Admins can access sensitive endpoints like `/api/v1/users` and `/api/v1/products`.
- Regular users may have access to endpoints such as `/api/v1/orders`, but cannot access endpoints that modify system settings.

### 2.3. **Access Control for API Endpoints**

The platform uses the JWT token to authenticate and authorize requests. API endpoints check the user's role from the token and enforce access control as follows:

- **Admin Only Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/users`: Create a new user (Admin only).
  - `DELETE /api/v1/products/{product_id}`: Delete a product (Admin only).
  
- **User Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/orders`: Retrieve the list of the authenticated user’s orders.
  - `PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id}`: Update the authenticated user’s details.
  
- **Guest Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/products`: View the list of products available in the catalog.
  - `GET /api/v1/public-info`: Access public information.

### 2.4. **Access Token Validation**

When a request is made to a protected endpoint, the server must validate the JWT token in the Authorization header. The validation process involves:

1. **Checking the Token Format**: The token should be a valid JWT format (three base64-encoded segments separated by dots).
2. **Verifying the Signature**: The token’s signature is verified using the server's secret key to ensure the integrity of the token.
3. **Checking Token Expiry**: The server checks the `exp` (expiration) claim in the token. If the token is expired, the user is prompted to log in again.
4. **Extracting the Role**: The token contains claims that include the user's role (e.g., `role: admin`). Based on this, the server enforces authorization rules.

## 3. **Token Security Considerations**

To enhance the security of the authentication process, the following best practices should be observed:

1. **Secure Transmission**:
   - All authentication requests should be transmitted over HTTPS to protect against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
   
2. **Token Storage**:
   - Tokens should be stored securely, preferably in a **secure cookie** or **session storage**. Avoid using **local storage** for tokens in client-side JavaScript applications, as it may expose the token to XSS attacks.

3. **Token Revocation**:
   - Although JWT tokens cannot be directly revoked before expiration, the platform should provide mechanisms to invalidate or revoke tokens at the server-side, such as maintaining a blacklist of tokens or implementing short-lived tokens with refresh capabilities.

4. **Password Hashing**:
   - User passwords should never be stored in plain text. Instead, a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) should be used to store hashed passwords. During authentication, the provided password is hashed and compared against the stored hash.
