# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Overview
This section outlines the non-functional requirements for the system. These requirements specify the criteria that define the quality attributes the system must adhere to, such as performance, scalability, security, and usability.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance
- **Description**: The system must perform efficiently under expected load conditions.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must respond to user requests within **2 seconds** for 95% of all interactions.
  - The system must be able to handle at least **1,000 concurrent users** without significant degradation in performance.
  - Data retrieval operations should complete within **3 seconds** even when querying large datasets (up to 10,000 records).
  - Batch processing jobs, such as generating reports, should complete within **10 minutes** for datasets up to **500,000 records**.

### 2.2 Scalability
- **Description**: The system should be scalable to accommodate growing user numbers, data volume, and transaction frequency.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must be able to scale horizontally to support increasing user traffic by adding more servers or resources without significant changes to the core architecture.
  - The system should be able to scale up to handle a **100% increase** in users and data volume over the next **3 years**.
  - The database must support sharding or partitioning to manage large datasets efficiently.

### 2.3 Reliability
- **Description**: The system must be reliable and available to end-users with minimal downtime.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must provide **99.9% uptime** (i.e., no more than **8 hours** of downtime per year).
  - The system should automatically recover from most failure conditions, such as database crashes, within **5 minutes**.
  - The system must log all critical errors and provide clear notifications to administrators when issues occur.

### 2.4 Security
- **Description**: The system must adhere to security best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Requirements**:
  - All data transmitted over the network must be encrypted using **SSL/TLS** protocols.
  - User passwords must be **hashed** using a secure algorithm (e.g., **bcrypt**) before being stored in the database.
  - The system must support **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all users accessing sensitive data or performing high-risk actions.
  - The system should implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to data based on user roles.
  - Sensitive data, such as credit card information, must be encrypted in storage using **AES-256** encryption.
  - The system must pass regular **security audits** and vulnerability assessments.

### 2.5 Usability
- **Description**: The system should be easy to use and provide a positive user experience.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labeling and organized interfaces.
  - The system must provide an online help section or tooltips for users to easily find instructions or assistance.
  - The system’s user interface (UI) should be designed with accessibility in mind, complying with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
  - The system should support a responsive design, ensuring that it works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### 2.6 Maintainability
- **Description**: The system must be easy to maintain and extend over time.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must be built using modular and well-documented code to facilitate future updates and extensions.
  - The system should have automated unit tests covering at least **80%** of the code base to ensure maintainability and stability during future changes.
  - The system must provide detailed error messages and logging to assist developers in troubleshooting issues.
  - The codebase should follow established coding standards and best practices, such as those defined in the company’s coding guidelines.

### 2.7 Portability
- **Description**: The system must be portable to different operating environments and platforms.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should be able to run on common operating systems, including **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
  - The application must be able to run on modern web browsers, including **Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge**.
  - The system should be containerized (using Docker, for example) to facilitate deployment across different environments, including cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### 2.8 Compliance and Legal
- **Description**: The system must comply with relevant laws and regulations governing data protection, privacy, and industry standards.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** for users in the European Union, ensuring that personal data is processed with the user’s consent and stored securely.
  - The system should adhere to industry-specific standards (e.g., **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**) for handling sensitive data like payment information.
  - The system must support the ability to export, delete, or anonymize user data upon request in compliance with privacy regulations.

### 2.9 Localization and Internationalization
- **Description**: The system should support users from different regions and languages.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must support multiple languages, starting with **English, Spanish, French, and German**.
  - The system should be capable of handling region-specific formats for dates, numbers, and currencies (e.g., **MM/DD/YYYY** vs. **DD/MM/YYYY**).
  - The system must allow users to select their preferred language and locale from the settings page.

### 2.10 Backup and Recovery
- **Description**: The system must ensure that data can be recovered in the event of a failure or disaster.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must perform **daily** backups of the database and user data, with backups stored in a separate location (offsite or cloud storage).
  - The system must provide a **disaster recovery plan** (DRP) to recover from major system failures, such as hardware crashes or data corruption.
  - The system must allow the restoration of backups to a specific point in time within the last **72 hours**.

## 3. Additional Non-Functional Requirements
- Any other relevant non-functional requirements that may emerge throughout the project's lifecycle will be documented in subsequent revisions of this document.
