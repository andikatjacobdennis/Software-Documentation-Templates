# Functional Requirements

## 1. Overview
This section provides a detailed description of the functional requirements for the system. These requirements outline the core functions that the system must perform to meet the needs of the users and stakeholders.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication
- **Description**: The system must provide a secure user authentication process to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should support user login using a username and password.
  - The system must implement two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.
  - The system should allow users to reset their password through a secure process (e.g., email verification).
  - The system must lock the account after 5 failed login attempts and send a notification to the user.

### 2.2 Data Entry
- **Description**: The system must allow users to input data in various forms.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users must be able to input text, dates, and numerical values into the system using forms.
  - Input forms must have validation to ensure that all required fields are filled and that data types (e.g., numbers, dates) are correct.
  - Users must be able to upload files, and the system must support the following formats: PDF, DOCX, JPG.
  - The system should validate the file size and type before uploading.

### 2.3 Data Retrieval and Reporting
- **Description**: The system must allow users to retrieve and generate reports based on stored data.
- **Requirements**:
  - Users must be able to search for records using specific criteria (e.g., date range, keywords).
  - The system should generate reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV).
  - The system must provide an option for users to export the data as a CSV file.
  - The system must allow users to filter data based on parameters such as category, date, and status.

### 2.4 Notifications
- **Description**: The system must notify users about critical events, updates, or actions.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must send email notifications for successful account registration, password reset, and security alerts.
  - Users must be able to configure notification preferences, including email, SMS, and in-app notifications.
  - Notifications should be triggered for important system events (e.g., transaction confirmations, status updates).

### 2.5 User Roles and Permissions
- **Description**: The system must provide role-based access control to manage user permissions.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should allow users to have different roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
  - Administrators must have the ability to manage user roles and permissions.
  - The system must restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.
  - Users should only be able to access data and functionality relevant to their assigned role.

### 2.6 Data Security
- **Description**: The system must ensure that user data and sensitive information are protected.
- **Requirements**:
  - All user passwords must be hashed and encrypted before storage.
  - Sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, personal information) must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256).
  - The system must log all access to sensitive data, and the logs should be available for auditing purposes.
  - The system should support role-based encryption access to sensitive data.

### 2.7 Integration with Third-Party Services
- **Description**: The system must be able to integrate with external services to enhance functionality.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must support integration with payment gateways for processing transactions (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
  - The system should allow integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google OAuth, Facebook Login).
  - The system must allow integration with external APIs for real-time weather data, shipping tracking, etc.
  - The integration with external services must be secure, with appropriate error handling in case of failure.

### 2.8 Audit and Logging
- **Description**: The system must maintain logs of important user actions and system events for security and troubleshooting.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must log all user login attempts, including successful and failed logins.
  - The system must log changes made to sensitive data (e.g., profile updates, financial transactions).
  - Logs must be available for review and must not be tampered with.
  - Logs should be stored for a minimum of 12 months.

### 2.9 Performance
- **Description**: The system must meet certain performance requirements to ensure a responsive user experience.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must respond to user queries within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
  - The system must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
  - Data retrieval operations should complete within 3 seconds, even when querying large datasets.

## 3. Additional Functional Requirements
- Any other relevant functional requirements that may emerge from user feedback, stakeholder inputs, or technical constraints will be documented in subsequent revisions of this document.
