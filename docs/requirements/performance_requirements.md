# Performance Requirements

## 1. Overview
This section outlines the performance requirements for the system. These requirements define how well the system should perform under various conditions, including response times, scalability, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance is crucial to ensuring the system can handle the expected workload and provide a satisfactory user experience.

- **Requirements**:
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: The system must be able to scale horizontally by adding more server instances to accommodate increased traffic without significant modification to the application architecture.
  - **Vertical Scaling**: The system should be able to scale vertically to utilize more powerful hardware (e.g., adding more CPU, memory) without significant performance degradation.
  - **Database Scalability**: The database must support sharding or partitioning to handle large datasets and ensure optimal performance even with **100% growth in data** over the next **3 years**.

### 2.4 Load Handling
- **Description**: The system must handle varying levels of load, from light to peak usage, without performance degradation.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Peak Load**: The system should be able to maintain performance during peak load conditions, such as **1,000 concurrent users** or **10,000 requests per minute**, without a response time exceeding **5 seconds** for any transaction.
  - **Stress Testing**: The system must be capable of enduring a stress test that simulates up to **50% more than expected peak load** for at least **30 minutes** without significant service degradation.

### 2.5 Availability
- **Description**: The system must ensure high availability, even under heavy load or during system maintenance.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system must meet an **uptime** of **99.9%** annually, allowing no more than **8 hours of downtime per year**.
  - The system should automatically recover from most failure scenarios within **5 minutes** (e.g., database failure, server crash).

### 2.6 Resource Utilization
- **Description**: The system should efficiently utilize hardware resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space) to ensure that performance requirements are met while minimizing resource consumption.
- **Requirements**:
  - The system should not exceed **70% CPU utilization** under normal operating conditions.
  - The system should not consume more than **2 GB of memory** per active process under normal workload conditions.
  - The database should use **optimized queries** to ensure that disk I/O does not exceed **70%** of the available disk capacity.
  - The system should employ caching mechanisms to reduce load on backend services and optimize response times.

### 2.7 Database Performance
- **Description**: The system must maintain high database performance, ensuring quick retrieval and modification of data.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Query Performance**: Queries, including complex joins and aggregations, should return results in under **3 seconds** for datasets with up to **100,000 records**.
  - **Indexing**: The database must support proper indexing to ensure fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
  - **Transaction Performance**: Database transactions should be committed within **2 seconds** in a transaction-heavy environment (e.g., user updates, payment processing).

### 2.8 Data Consistency
- **Description**: The system must ensure data consistency across distributed components and databases, particularly in the context of high-load scenarios.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Consistency**: The system must ensure strong consistency for transactional data, following the **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles.
  - **Replication**: In case of distributed databases, the system must ensure that data replication is completed within **2 minutes** of any change to ensure data consistency across all nodes.

### 2.9 Latency
- **Description**: The system must minimize latency in all aspects of its operation to maintain responsiveness.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Database Latency**: The average latency for database read operations must not exceed **200 milliseconds** under normal usage.
  - **Network Latency**: Network latency between distributed components should not exceed **100 milliseconds** in an optimized configuration.

### 2.10 Testing and Validation
- **Description**: The system's performance must be validated through appropriate testing methods and tools.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Performance Testing**: The system must undergo regular performance testing, including load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing, to ensure it meets the required performance benchmarks.
  - **Monitoring**: Performance metrics, such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization, must be monitored in real-time and logged for future analysis.
  - **Benchmarking**: The system must achieve benchmark performance scores based on predefined test scenarios before going into production.
